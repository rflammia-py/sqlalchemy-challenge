use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Precipitation Analysis
Start by finding the most recent date in the data set.

Using this date, retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data by querying the 12 preceding months of data. Note you do not pass in the date as a variable to your query.

Station Analysis
Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.

Design a query to find the most active stations (i.e. which stations have the most rows?).
